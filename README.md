My personal portfolio website created HTML,CSS, and Bootstrap.
The design is a responsive single page theme.

Many users that access the internet today do so with mobile devices so I wanted to create a single page design because scrolling is faster and more convenient for both mobile and desktop users which is perfect for a simple portfolio website. 

Note to self - Bootstrap no longer working. Will need to fix.
